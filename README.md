# Online_Course_Console

This project is dedicated to the Pi Organization's online courses. The platform allows users to access various courses, but there are certain steps and restrictions in place to ensure a smooth experience.

## Getting Started

Before users can access any course, they must complete the sign-up process. Once registered, users should not create another account and can simply sign in using their email and password.

## Course Access

After signing up or signing in, users can browse the available courses. However, joining a course is not an automatic process. Users need permission from a member of the Pi Organization or the Pi Organization Admin. This step is necessary to validate payments. Users are required to send their payment via balance or fastpay, so the Admin can verify whether the user has paid or not.

## Downloading Courses

Once a user has been granted access to a course, they can view and download the course content. This feature enables users to learn at their own pace and convenience.

## Managing Your Account

Users have the flexibility to sign out and sign in again whenever they need to access the platform. This feature provides ease of use and allows users to manage their learning experience effectively.
